<h1>Denver Commercial Photography</h1>
    <p>
I started shooting commercial photography a long time ago.  In all reality my very first client was a commercial photography gig.  I'll never forget that first experience.  Someone hired me to take pictures of their apartment building, both inside shots, and outdoor shots.  I was extremely excited for the opportunity to actually put my photography to work for me for a change.  This was my first shoot that I actually made money off of all the hard work I had put into my photography.  
</p>
<p>
In reality looking back it was actually a pretty decent paying job.  Businesses seem to have quite a bit more budget for photography than individuals.  It's hard for an individual to rationalize spending money on something that is seen by some as vain.  Even though in the end it's all about how you market yourself. 
</p>
<p>
I went above and beyond for that first job.  It was my first chance to really impress someone with my work, and while it was good, it was far from great.  It was the best I could do at the time, but I've come a long way since then.  That client wanted some exterior shots of the building, but they weren't expecting me to shoot both during the day and at night.  So I stood out in the cold getting a ton of long exposure shots for them.  Shots that added a certain fun downtown feel to them.  Something that they could use to really sell their apartments to their high end clients.  Something that really caught the viewers eye.
</p>
<p>
Since then I've come a long way, I've shot for major magazines, and had my images on the cover of a few.  I'm more than capable of getting fantastic headshots, or product shots for any business.  
</p>
<p>
The next major client I had was the denver center for performing arts.  I had a friend that found my work, and introduced me to one of the heads of the building over there.  They wanted some work to hang in the hallways that gave the building a modern feel.  So I waited until sunset, and then composited together a few shots to get some crazy architecture effects.  The building itself is actually quite gorgeous.  
</p>
<p>
After that I had started working on more portraits and I got into taking business headshots.  That's where I really excel.  I can do product photography, but I really like headshots.  I love meeting people, and hearing how they have arrived at their current position.  It' fun hearing all the different stories about how people came to be in the positions they are.  I've shot everything from accountants to oil magnates.  Something I always love telling my friends about.  I've had my work on the cover of major industrial magazines, and my editorials put alongside some really interesting stories of trial and tribulation.  
</p>
<p>
Sometimes my clients need me to come onsite, and boy do I love doing that.  There's a ton of people to interact with when you do that, and you always end up meeting new people who might want something different after the shoot.  
</p>
<p>
I've even done magazine shoots where we had to put makeup on the male model.  Which I always find interesting, but it's crazy what people will do to make sure their results are perfect.
<p>
    My clients have included The Bank and Boston Lofts, The Denver Center For Perfoming Arts, The Denver Aquarium, Linger, New York Food Review, and many others.
