                    <strong>Do you also do shoots with normal, non-model people?</strong><br />
                    I do shoots will all sorts of people.  I mainly shoot fashion, but I've worked with everyone from bands, to top chefs.  I love taking pictures of people, so if you have something in mind, contact me,
                    and we can get working on putting together an awesome shoot for you!

                <p>
                    <strong>Why do your rates vary?</strong><br />
                    Different projects require different skills, some of them take more time in post, some are more time consuming to plan.  It really depends on what you're looking for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>What is the Non-refundable reservation fee for?</strong><br />
                    It acts as a force field, some sort of protection and assurance that both yours and the photographer’s time and effort won’t be put to waste.

                    <strong>Do I need to book in advance?</strong><br />
                    Me and my team can’t accommodate everyone all the time so advance booking is highly recommended.

                    <strong>Can I get all the images from the shoot?</strong><br />

                <p>
                    <strong>How long should I wait before I get my photos?</strong><br />
                    It depends. Could be within 2 weeks to 4 weeks. Some shoots require more post processing (photoshop) than others do.  I can easily give you an estimate when we're shooting.

We could talk about your wardrobe upon our meeting/consultation. Also, If you want, I can refer you to my network of stylists who could turn your wardrobe dilemma to a piece of cake.
