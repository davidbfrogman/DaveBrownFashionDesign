    <h2>Denver Engagement Photographer</h2>
    <p>
        When I first started shooting engagements I had only been doing portrait work for a short amount of time. I'm still shocked that I got my first booking. The couple had come to me, because they really wanted to get creative shots for their engagement. They wanted something different than everyone else. Which I thought was super cool. Now at this point I was still really green, and I'm fairly convinced that I didn't give them exactly what they were looking for. Instead I got them shots that pretty much looked like what all the wedding photographers at the time were doing. Something I'm kinda sad about. Now I was trying to make a real business out of this, and super weird engagement photography isn't something that a lot of people are looking for.

After that first session though, I was hooked. I had a ton of fun working with that couple, and I was happy with what I had produced. Slowly over time I began to build up my clientele. Which was a ton of fun. I had the chance to meet a ton of new people and hear their stories. I know this sounds weird, but I think I like learning peoples stories as much as I like taking pictures of them. Everyone has such interesting dynamics, and it's fun to get a window into that world. Why are they getting married? When did they meet. How long have they been dating. All these are such interesting questions to me. What makes one man want to marry another woman. It's not always clear on first blush. She might be pretty, but is there something more. What does each person get out of it.

After a while I started to feel like I was really good at engagement shoots. It's something that I feel like I have a real talent for. I think I'm great at getting people to actually love each other on camera. Something I don't feel like everyone is good at.  Not that I have some magic potion though.  I'll never forget one couple that had a total meltdown on our shoot.  Honestly I couldn't tell you why they were getting married.  It seemed like this couple should stay as far away from the alter as possible.  The groom to be was so unhappy about having his picture taken it was almost shocking that he was going to get married.  The poor girl spent most of the shoot trying to calm him down, before he simply erupted in anger about 'not wanting to wear his boots'.  No idea why that was such a big deal, but man did he freak out.  I was struggling between giving them back their money, and powering through the shoot.  In the end I felt so bad for the girl that I decided not to make her life worse by handing back their money and ending the shoot.

        I photograph on location in the <b>Denver metro area</b>, but I am also available to shoot almost anywhere
        in the front range area.  Depending on location there might be a travel fee.
