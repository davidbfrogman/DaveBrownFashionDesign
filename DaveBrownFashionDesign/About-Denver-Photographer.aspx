        <h2>Commercial Services</h2>
        <p>
            I offer a wide range of services to meet the needs of any client.  From lookbooks, to editorial spreads, to catalog shoots I can produce high quality images that will 
            capture the interest of your clients or customers.
        </p>
        <h2>Editorial Services</h2>
        <p>
            Producing editorials takes creativity, skill, and attention to detail, while at the same time telling a story.  Editorials need to move the viewer through a range of emotions.
            I have the skills to take your viewers on a journey through these emotions with my images.  I'd love to know more about the story you want to tell, and how I can convey that to your
            viewers.

        <h2>Model Portfolios/Actor Headshots</h2>
        <p>
            Putting together a great compcard involves getting just the right angles, while at the same time producing timeless clean images that will sell your features to any agency.  I've been 
            working with models, and their agencies for over 5 years now, and I know what an agent will love, and what will start booking you work in no time.  Please contact me for my rates, so I can
            help you put together a really amazing comp card. 
        </p>
        <h2>Corporate Headshots</h2>
        <p>
            Putting your best foot forward often involves having a killer headshot.  Something people can relate to, while at the same time showing a bit of personality.  I've been doing headshots,
            and portraits for over 10 years now.  I have my own studio, or I can come to you.  Either way you'll get a fantastic headshot that make you stand out amongst the crowd. 
        </p>
        <h2>Engagement Photography</h2>
        <p>
            I only take on a limited number of engagement shoots every year, even though I do love them.  It's so much fun for me to see a couple interact and capture the little moments that happen 
            when nobody is looking.  I like finding the real moments that are expressed when two people are truly in love.  I've been doing engagement shoots for over 10 years now so I'm sure I can
            capture exactly what you're looking for.  No need to be nervous with me, as I've worked with hundreds of couples to capture these special moments.  I'll guide you and your fiance through
            the entire shoot, and you'll barely realize you're having your picture taken.  Whether it's a fun downtown shoot, or a rustic moutain vibe I have the skill and talent to produce amazing images that will make all of your friends
            jealous.
        </p>
        <h2>Band Photography</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly shooting bands is a new thing for me.  I love interacting with creative types, and bands certainly are the creative type.  I've had some amazing shoots in the small time that
            I've been shooting bands.  Shooting bands is suprisingly close to shooting fashion, it's just as creative, and I get to work in the areas that I feel most comfortable shooting,
            while at the same time producing cover art worthy shots.  I'd love to put together more band shoots, so if you're interested please contact me for rates.

        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m not like most photographers, I’m a bit more candid. artistic. fun. real. I’m all about allowing you to be exactly who you are…
        </p>
        <p>I specialize in portraiture. I especially love working with non-traditional, off-beat, creative, unique, far-out, interesting, totally awesome people, and couples. 
            I find it so rewarding to embrace our extreme differences while celebrating our common denominator. life. 
            If you feel this is you, and you want artistically amazing photos, well, then I am your perfect photographer&nbsp;:)
