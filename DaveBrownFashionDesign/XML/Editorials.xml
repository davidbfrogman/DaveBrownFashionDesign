     <h1>Lindsey Vonn for the cover of Rhapsody Magazine</h1>
      <p>
          I had an awesome opportunity to shoot Lindsey Vonn for an editorial in Rhapsody Magazine. I was super excited to get to work with my first big star, and we got some amazing shots for the magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
          I was actually down in Austin when I got the call that Rhapsody wanted me to shoot their cover story. I kinda freaked out a little bit. It actually took me a little while before I was convinced that I could handle the job. I had to call a few people to convince me I'd be crazy not to take a cover story.
      </p>
      <p>
          After working out all the details for the shoot I agreed to show up a bit early to do some location scouting. We were shooting at the Ritz Carlton in Vail. Which was an amazing place. I can only imagine how expensive it is to live there. The early part of the morning was spent walking around with the creative director on set, talking through what they would want to do with the shots. The mood that they were going for. They wanted it to be more of a fashion shoot with warm lighting, perfect for my style.
      </p>
      <p>
          I had never worked on a project this big. Hair, makeup, wardrobe stylist, writer, creative director, photography editor, assistants, handlers, it was a huge ordeal. Which probably explains why we started so late. That's ok, though I think some of my favorite shots from the shoot only happened because we started so late.
      </p>
      <p>
          We started the day in her own gondola. I know crazy right? She's got her own gondola, that they put on the line just for her, and this shoot. I have to say when the shoot started I was a bit worried. We started shooting, and I didn't feel any connection from her. She seemed pretty good at posing, and stuff, but there wasn't much of a connection. To her, this was just another shoot. She had 3 that day alone.
      </p>
      <p>
          Once we got in the gondola though it was a totally different story. I got to ask her about the broncos game she had gone to the night before, and suddenly she opened up. We talked about how hard it is to not drink any beer, because at the time she was training hard for the Olympics, but she was funny and energized, and a total doll to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
          After the gondola, we moved onto shooting in one of the giant suites at the Ritz. To say the place was gorgeous was an understatement. We had a blast putting her in all different kinds of outfits and getting interesting looks out of her.
      </p>
      <p>
          At the end we did some shots in a makeshift studio. They were thinking they were going to use those ones for the cover, but we ended up going in a different direction. They ended up using some of the sunset shots, which I totally loved for the cover.
      </p>
      <p>
          Overall I was extremely happy with the way the shoot went, and I certainly learned plenty about being under that kind of pressure. It was a complete blast to shoot something that big, and I'm excited for the next time I get to work on a shoot that big.

     <h1>Wanderlust Editorial for Ellements Magazine</h1>
      <p>
      I was so excited to shoot this editorial.  I had this editorial in my head for a very long time.  It was something that I just needed to get out of my head.  I was super excited to get to work with such a great team.  I knew that I was going to have 2 fantastic models, for this shoot, but I went with someone new for Hair and makeup.  Which I was super happy with, and it turned out that this was the makeup artist first publication.  Which was totally awesome.  I love it when people are firts published with my work.
      </p>
      <p>
      For my models I picked 2 girls that I had worked with before, people I knew I could count on.  A shoot as I say is always made by the weakest link in the team.  So picking models that you trust, and you know will 'bring it' on the day of a shoot makes the whole shoot easier.  
      </p>
      <p>
      I started out location scouting in Red Rocks park.  Which I have to say I wasn't exactly the best little camper ever.  I didn't exactly stay on the trails, and I managed to find a really cool location that was a bit off the trail.  Of course you're not exactly supposed to go back there, but I thought it would be ok.  More on that later. :)
      <br />
      After red rocks park I moved on to do some location scouting around there.  I found a cool location that seemed to be the start of a hiking trail, but was also what seemed to be an abandoned road, a shed that was trashed. 

      I also managed to find some cool park like locations that weren't actually in the red rocks park... boy did those come in handy.  Again more on that later.
      </p>
      <p>
      We started the day off with hair and makeup with Samantha Koch.  The girls got ready quickly.  After that me and one of the model who had also done some of the styling starting picking out exactly what clothes we were going to put together for this shoot.  I wanted a bit bohemian, but also a bit edgy.  Once we had all the looks picked out, and the girls hair was ready, we were ready to go.
      </p>
      <p>
	      The first location was probably the funniest.  And hence why I wanted to wait and tell you guy s about it.  So we went to Red Rocks, a bit off of the beaten path.  Not exactly legal, but we were behind a bunch of huge rocks so I figured nobody could see us.  We'd be fine.  Right?  Apparently not.  A while into shooting a few park rangers showed up and quickly scolded us for being where we shouldn't be.  They weren't exactly happy about us jumping a fence to get to where we were shooting.  They asked us to specifically show them exactly how we got to our location.  They were expecting us to show them that we jumped a fence, but I was way ahead of them.  I had already found a location in the fence where it had a nice gap, something that could be construed to look like an opening.  After showing them that they were forced to simply give us a warning, and direct me to talk to the person who was in charge of booking shoots on the property.  I kinda felt bad the whole time they were scolding us, because one of the models was wearing a see through shirt with no bra on, and wasn't exactly comfortable having a 25 year old park ranger stare at her in a leering way.  
      </p>
      <p>
	      After that whole experience we moved pretty quickly through the rest of the shoot.  We relocated to another public park that seemed to have a lot less restrictions on where all you could go.  In the end I was actually quite happy that the park rangers kicked us out of Red rocks.  It made me shoot more in the other public park, and in the end I had some gorgeous light to work with, and I was really happy with the way those shots turned out.
      </p>
      <p>
	      After all that I moved on to my abandoned location.  Which was great, the light was just barely peeking through the corner of the mountians, and it came off amazingly well on camera.  In the end the shot where the model is posing implied with just a jacket over her, is quite possible in my top 5 shots of all time.  Frankly it wasn't even my idea.  It was the other models idea, and boy did I love it.  
      </p>
      <p>
	      After the shoot I knew I had some magical shots, and I wanted to aim high, and that's why I was very careful where I submitted my images to.  I sent them around to aim as I high as I thought was realistic, and ended up having them published in ellements magazine.  Of course I was stupid proud and happy about that fact.

        <h1>Firestarter Editorial in IMute Magazine</h1>

        <p>
        So the funny thing about this editorial wasn't that I had some big grandious plan for it, it was actually the complete opposite.  In reality this was test work that just turned into an editorial.  I hadn't even planned on doing anything with these shots, but then after the shoot I was amazed at how gorgeous eva looks, and I knew that I wanted to get them published somewhere.  Now I didn't exactly do a great job shooting this like an editorial.  I didn't pull amazing clothes, or anything crazy.  Hell I just barely went location scouting for this shoot. 
        </p>
        <p>
	        We started out at my studio close to downtown.  Of course I had the usual team: me, Lynzi, Kadie, and of course Eva, and her absolutely fantastic mother.  I have a bit of a crush on Eva's mom.  She's hilarious, and I really wish I would have grown up with a mother like that.  Sounds like Eva's dad is pretty funny too.  Their whole family is fantastic.  This was my first time working with Eva, and I was so wildly impressed.  She's an amazing model, and a total blast to work with.  She's a complete goofball.  It makes the shooting go so much easier.  It's also so much easier to be creative when you're working with fun people and you have a smile on your face
        </p>
        <p>
	        After we got out to our location we started shooting and immediatly I knew this was going to be a great shoot.  Eva has fantastic movements.  Combined with the fact that she's drop dead gorgeous.  It was truly easy to shoot her.  We honestly put together a whole editorial quite easily just shooting one location.  What I did was try and use one small location in as many ways as I could.  To do this I chose to shoot all the different kinds of light the location had, along with using some artificial light to create even more drama in the shots.
        </p>
        <p>
	        For all the natural light photographs we went for that warm drenched look that I love so much.  I shot with a ton of rear lighting which was complicated when I first started shooting like that, but over time I found that this was my favorite style, and now it's fully integrated into my photography.  
        </p>
        <p>
	        After I got done shooting the natural light stuff, I brought out some of my strobes for even more drama in the shots.  I used a beauty dish in the shade with barely any power behind it.  I also used a neutral density filter to drop my exposure even further, and yet still be able to use a wide open aperture.  Now you can see in the shots that I really didn't have to add very much light, because it's really not needed to put a ton of punch into a photo.
