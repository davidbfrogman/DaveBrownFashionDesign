<h1>Denver High School Senior Portrait Photography</h1>
<p>
I started shooting senior portraits a long time ago.  I had always thought that interesting people make for interesting shots, so I decided that the best way to get interesting shots in my portfolio was to work with young, attractive people and get some killer shots in my portfolio.  
</p>
<p>
My first senior was named Brandy and we had a total blast on our shoot.  She told me all about her plans to move down to missouri to go to college there, she planned on studying acting, and she was really dying to get out of the small town she grew up in.  
</p>
<p>
She was a typical senior full of hopes and dreams, and it makes you really stop and think about how far you have come since you were a snot nosed high school kid.   I know I've come a long way, but I also realize there's still a lot that I want to do with my life.  That's why I'm chasing my dream of being a photographer so hard right now.  I really think that If I put enough work into this, that I can actually make it as a full time photographer.  
</p>
<p>
I certainly try and pull of my fashion experience into my senior shoots.  I know how to properly light people, to create dynamic, and interesting portraits.  I'm sure that I can create amazing shots of any high school senior.
